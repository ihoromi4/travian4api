Welcome to Travian Legends API's documentation!
===============================================

Welcome to Travian Legends API's documentation. This documentation is divided into different parts. I recommend that you get started with Installation and then head over to the Quickstart. If you'd rather dive into the internals of Travian Legends API, check out the API documentation.

Travian Legends API depends on two external libraries: the requests and the BeautifulSoup. These libraries are not documented here.
